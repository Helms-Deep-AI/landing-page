## **Product Title**: Wizard

## **Overview**
The **Wizard** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generative AI (RAG-AI) system designed to align children's education and exploration with their family’s values. It exclusively generates responses and recommendations from pre-approved, whitelisted resources, ensuring a safe, trustworthy, and focused learning environment. The Wizard is optimized to instill family-driven cultural narratives and goals while protecting children from harmful external influences.
