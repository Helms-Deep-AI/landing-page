## Overview

Enkrasia introduces **The Fortress**, a household internet traffic filtering service that creates a safe, controlled online environment for children. By enforcing a strict whitelist policy, it ensures only pre-approved resources are accessible, while blocking everything else. This serves as an impenetrable digital fortress to protect children from harmful content, maintain focus, and enhance their educational experience.

## Key Features

- **Default Deny-All Policy**: All traffic is blocked by default until explicitly whitelisted.
- **Whitelist Enforcement**: Only pre-approved, safe websites and services are allowed, ensuring security and peace of mind.
- **Centralized Control**: A simple whitelist service for managing and approving domains and online resources.
- **Whole-House Protection**: Operates at the network level, ensuring that all connected devices are filtered and secure.
- **Child-Safe Internet**: Blocks inappropriate, harmful content to provide a child-friendly online environment.
- **Lightweight and Simple**: Easy to set up, deploy, and maintain. Minimal setup with resource-efficient performance.

## How It Works

1. **Traffic Interception**: All internet requests from household devices are intercepted by the Fortress server.
2. **Whitelist Check**: The server verifies each request against a pre-approved whitelist of websites and resources.
3. **Allow or Block**: If the requested content is whitelisted, access is granted. If not, the request is blocked.

## Use Cases

- **Parental Controls**: Restrict children's devices to only educational or child-safe content.
- **Secure Households**: Protect your household from accidental or malicious access to inappropriate content.
- **Focus and Productivity**: Limit access to specific websites and tools to enhance productivity and reduce distractions.
  
## Security Features

- **Strict Deny-All Policy**: Adheres to a "deny all" policy, ensuring no unapproved content slips through.
- **Minimal Exposure**: Does not accept incoming requests from external networks, minimizing the risk of attack.
- **Auditable**: The whitelist and logs are stored in plain text, allowing for easy review and maintenance by parents.

## Pain Points Addressed

- **Prevention of Harmful Content**: Protect children from harmful websites, scams, and online dangers.
- **Fostering Excellence**: Ensure children have access to educational and beneficial content that enhances their growth.
- **Clear Communication**: Enable parents to explain the reasoning behind restrictions and help children understand when and why they will gain broader access.
- **Training and Education**: Provide children with an educational foundation that prepares them for future internet usage in a safe, informed way.
- **Balanced Device Use**: Limit the use of smartphones and encourage more productive devices like laptops or dedicated educational tools.
  
## Trends

- Growing concerns about childrenâ€™s mental health, internet addiction, and exposure to harmful content (e.g., books like *The Anxious Generation* and documentaries like *The Social Dilemma*).
