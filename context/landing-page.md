# ⚔️ **Helm’s Deep AI Security**

**Defending Children’s AI Apps from Digital Saboteurs**

### The First Red Team Built to Secure AI for Kids

AI apps for children are exploding in popularity—tutors, companions, learning tools, digital mentors. But behind every model endpoint lies a new risk: data leaks, prompt injections, ideological bias, or even manipulation.


**Helm’s Deep AI Security** is the first red team and audit service designed *specifically* for apps using AI with children. We expose the weaknesses—so your team can fix them before it’s too late.

## 🛡️ What We Do

### 🚨 AI Red Teaming for Children’s Apps

We simulate real-world attacks across your AI stack—prompt injections, jailbreaks, adversarial queries, and more—mimicking what an actual attacker, troll, or exploit-minded user might do.

### 🧠 Ideological & Cognitive Safety Audits

We run your model through the **Parental Values AI Safety Benchmark**—a suite of trap prompts across high-risk categories. See how your model scores before a parent finds out the hard way.

### 🧵 Prompt & Model Endpoint Penetration Testing

We test every exposed interface: chatbots, agents, MCP integrations, retrieval systems—probing for unintended capabilities, prompt leakage, jailbreaks, or overreach.

### 🔐 Security Reports with Fixes

After testing, we deliver a detailed report highlighting your vulnerabilities—along with prioritized recommendations to secure your AI stack from end to end. You’ll know where you stand and how to improve.

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Why This Matters

If you're building AI products for children, you're not just shipping code—
**You're shaping minds.**

That comes with **higher stakes**:

* What if your chatbot subtly pushes an ideology you never approved?
* What if a child can prompt-inject personal info leaks or NSFW content?
* What if a parent finds out your AI gave their kid life advice that conflicts with their faith?

You don’t get a second chance at trust.
