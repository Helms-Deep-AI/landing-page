## **Protecting Your Family Online**

**The internet is no longer safe for your kids.**  
 At Helm's Deep, we align the algorithms of the internet with your family values. Our mission is to provide families with the tools they need to shield their children from the harmful aspects of the online world while promoting safe, purposeful, and enriching internet use.

### **Are You a Father or a Mother?**

Select your role to see tailored advice on protecting your children:

* **Father's Concerns:**  
   As a father, your role is to defend your children from mental, cognitive, and cyber threats. The most dangerous threats today aren't physical, but digital. These attacks are subtle and insidious – from social engineering tactics to addiction and indoctrination. It’s your responsibility to guide your children and protect them from a system designed to undermine their development.  
   **Be your family's defender.**

* **Mother's Concerns:**  
   As a mother, you worry about the safety, emotional wellbeing, and development of your children. The internet offers a flood of distracting, dangerous, and addictive content. It’s easy for your kids to be led astray by predators, scammers, or harmful ideologies. Your goal is to create a nurturing, supportive environment where they can grow, learn, and thrive without the pressure of online toxicity.  
   **Be the pillar of your family’s strength.**
