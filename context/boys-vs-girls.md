Here’s a detailed table outlining the different risks for boys and girls with internet usage, paired with solutions from Helm's Deep AI to address these risks effectively:

### Boys

*Fulfillment in digital simulations leads to a decline in achievement and engagement with school, work, and family life. Boys are now at great risk of "failing to launch" and becoming NEETs (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). For example, see Japan's "hikikomori" culture.*

| **Risk**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Helm's Deep Solution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Video Games**      | Overconsumption, exposure to violent or inappropriate content, and excessive screen time detracting from family interactions. 7% of boys develop serious addictions to video games, leading to declining physical and mental health, family strife, and failure to launch. | Block all online video games by default. Recommend only locally multiplayer games that encourage in-person social interaction with family/friends. Focus on alternatives such as family game nights or outdoor activities.                                                                                                                 |
| **Pornography**      | Early exposure to inappropriate content can harm emotional development and promote unhealthy relationships.                                                                                                                                                                | Block access to all explicit websites. Provide an educational guide for parents to discuss healthy sexuality with their children.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Female Streamers** | Risk of developing parasocial relationships or exposure to suggestive content.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Block streaming platforms or restrict access to whitelisted educational content. Collaborate with children on finding positive role models.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **AI Girlfriends**   | Encourages isolation, emotional dependency on virtual entities, and can hinder real-life social skill development.                                                                                                                                                         | Block AI-based relationship apps entirely. Recommend fostering real-life social interactions and family discussions about emotional intelligence.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Power Fantasies**  | Overexposure to power-driven narratives in books, TV, or media that may falsely fulfill desires for accomplishment. Boys end up shunning real-world risk, which is necessary for boys to develop into men.                                                                 | Block all online media by default. Choose paper books that exemplify your family culture. Choose movies to watch as a family. Encourage children to discuss story themes with parents to foster critical thinking.  Encourage engagement in real-world challenges, hobbies, and structured responsibilities like chores or part-time jobs. |
| **Social Media**     | Provides a fake "wolf pack" for boys, with none of the long-term trust or real-world support. Increases anomie due to lack of stable connections. Anomie breeds despair, suicide, and a sense of meaninglessness.                                                          | Provide opportunities for boys to form deep, stable relationships through real-life communities, mentoring programs, and family-focused activities. Encourage real-world social groups such as sports teams, clubs, or faith-based communities.                                                                                            |



### Girls

| **Risk**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Helm's Deep Solution**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Social Media**               | Girls are more harmed by social media than boys, with higher rates of depression and other disorders correlated to usage (See *Anxious Generation* by Haidt for evidence). Girls use visual platforms like Instagram and TikTok more than boys, worsening comparison culture. "Beauty Wars" occur where girls feel pressure to adopt tools like filters, makeup, and surgery to compete, making others appear plain in comparison. Social media also offers ways for girls to attack rivals by damaging relationships and reputations. Social media hijacks and frustrates the natural desires for communion. It promises connection but leaves users hollow and unfulfilled, offering low-trust relationships that lead to loneliness. | Block all social media by default, but whitelist specific accounts/channels that have been deemed positive influences, or helpful for child development. Focus on teaching children to curate positive and empowering content. Include discussions about the unrealistic standards perpetuated by beauty filters and strategies to develop resilience to social comparison. Teach children the importance of fostering real-life relationships and meaningful connections. Encourage family and community activities to fulfill these desires healthily. |
| **Online Shopping**            | Risk of impulsive spending or being influenced by consumer-driven trends and marketing tactics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Block e-commerce platforms by default, allowing access only to specific shopping sites approved by parents. Teach budgeting, frugality, and critical financial skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Romance Novels**             | Unrealistic portrayals of relationships and unhealthy emotional expectations. Potentially addictive and more appealing than educational reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Whitelist only age-appropriate novels and provide curated alternatives focused on meaningful, realistic storytelling. Discuss themes as a family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Predators/Social Engineers** | Girls are more likely to be groomed by online predators posing as trustworthy individuals. The effort and risk for men to stalk or approach girls is low, with minimal accountability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Block all messaging and social platforms. Whitelist only known and trusted accounts. Educate children on online safety, red flags, and when to alert a trusted adult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Sociogenic Illnesses**       | Girls are more vulnerable to "sociogenic" illnesses, or social contagion, where illnesses are psychosomatic rather than biological. Online filter bubbles can exacerbate this issue, where mentally ill individuals create support groups that form status hierarchies competing for victimhood, e.g., bulimia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Block access to harmful groups or platforms. Whitelist vetted support communities with oversight. Provide education to parents and children about the risks of social contagion and encourage open discussions about mental health.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Most of the internet is Trash, and amidst that Trash real dangers lurk. However, there are Treasures for those who seek them; and while Helm's Deep holds many Treasures inside, your child may discover a new one. When they do Helm's Deep enables the following process:

1. **Discovery:** The child discovers a part of the internet they would like to investigate.
2. **Parent-Child Discussion:** The child talks to their parents about why they believe exploring this content will enrich their life.
3. **Evaluation Criteria:** Parents discuss and evaluate the content using criteria such as:
   - Does this content foster personal growth and positive values?
   - Does this content contribute to wealth accumulation?
   - Does this content support finding a spouse and forming a family?
   - Does this content enrich the time with family?
   - Does this content provide for a need that is not met by in-person connections or existing, whitelisted content?
4. **Decision: Trash or Treasure:**
   - **Trash:** If the content is deemed a distraction or hindrance, the family discusses why it may seem enticing but ultimately detracts from the child’s growth and future potential.
     - **Threat:** If the content is actually trying to addict or otherwise manipulate the child, this would be a good time to reference the materials in \*\*The Training Grounds\*\* where the particular threat can be categorized and the child can be taught to recognize it in the future.  
   - **Treasure:** If the content is deemed valuable, the family agrees to whitelist it together, granting the child access while recognizing the child's contribution to the family culture and how they are finding the path for their culture's growth in the future. For example, if a child wishes to access a science-focused YouTube channel or an online coding course, the family can recognize how these resources support learning, skill-building, and shared goals, deeming them a Treasure.

### Summary: The Degrading Effects of a Phone-Based, Unguided Internet Life

A phone-based and unguided internet life pulls people away from their potential, degrading their ability to achieve happiness, well-being, trust, and group cohesion. It distracts individuals from their divine purpose and the meaningful pursuits of life.

- **Screen Time Misuse:** The average teen spends more than seven hours a day on screen-based leisure activities. Imagine the growth and development they could achieve by using this time productively!
- **Sleep Deprivation:** Phones and internet use often lead to sleep deprivation. Digital dopamine overstimulation makes it harder to prioritize rest, and blue light disrupts circadian rhythms. Sleep deprivation contributes to cognitive deficits, bad moods, and impaired decision-making.
- **ADHD and Executive Function:** Digital stimulation exacerbates or even leads to ADHD. Adolescents receive hundreds of notifications a day, interfering with the development of executive function, a critical skill for adulthood.
- **Addiction:** Many digital platforms are designed to be addictive, capturing children’s attention and trapping them in endless cycles of use.
- **Lack of Spiritual Meaning:** The virtual world mimics the appeal of spiritual communities but lacks true meaning and depth. The fragmented, distracting nature of phone-based life prevents self-transcendence and deep contemplation.

The phone-based life promises connection but leaves individuals hollow and unfulfilled. Through guidance and intentional use of technology, families can restore balance, fostering real-world relationships and ensuring children grow into their full potential.
